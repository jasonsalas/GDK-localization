Google Glass localization with the GDK 

This is a quick project that demonstrates the Glass Development Kit's support for localizing content. It depends on the language preference setting in MyGlass, from the mobile app or on the Web. St the time of this writing, only "English (United States)" and "English (United Kingdom)" are available options. Just build the project and install it on a live Glass device, which brings up a static card on the timeline. Then, bring up the Language setting in the "Select language" dialog in Settings in the MyGlass mobile app or click "Language" at http://google.com/myglass.

Toggling the language setting causes the app to display different content, localized for the user's country.
